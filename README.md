I work on helioseismology and magnetohydrodynamic simulations, focusing on the interaction between magnetic fields and surface gravity waves in the Sun. My research combines theory, high-resolution simulations, and helioseismic diagnostics.

*Effects of Dynamo-Generated Large-Scale Magnetic Fields on the Surface Gravity (f) Mode*  
arXiv:2602.05529 [astro-ph.SR]  
We perform 3D numerical simulations of an α²-dynamo in a two-layer solar setup to study how self-consistently generated large-scale magnetic fields modify the surface gravity (f) mode. We find enhanced f-mode frequencies and amplitudes in the saturated dynamo regime, with stronger effects at larger wavenumbers.
